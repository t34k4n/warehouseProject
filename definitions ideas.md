# Project Analysis

## Project Objective:
This project aims to develop an information system for managing warehouse data and rental processes. The system allows warehouse owners and agents to carry out warehouse rental and management operations, while enabling administrators to create user accounts.

## Project Scope:
- The system involves three main user roles: Administrator, Warehouse Owner, and Warehouse Agent.
- Users have different levels of access based on their roles.
- The system provides users with notifications and detailed reports.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Operations

#### Administrator Functions:
- Create warehouse owner and agent accounts.
- Edit existing user profiles.
- Provide performance evaluations by rating warehouse agents.

#### Warehouse Owner Functions:
- Add new warehouses with details such as warehouse size, climate conditions, warehouse type, and category.
- Rent out warehouses by selecting warehouse agents.
- Access reports about the warehouses they own (including date, status, address, and type of warehouse).
- View contract details and manage rental information.

#### Warehouse Agent Functions:
- Access information about available warehouses for rent.
- View rental history with details about past rentals.
- View information about active rental contracts.

### 2. System Notifications
- A notification is sent to the warehouse agent when a new rental request is made.
- A notification is sent to the warehouse owner when a warehouse is rented.
- A notification is sent to both the owner and warehouse agent when a contract is nearing its expiration.
